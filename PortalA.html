               Entity ID: 19 8 5 12 2 25 ; <br> Responds to Shelby <br>
                <br>
               Discovered: 1970, France <br>
               <br>
               Aura: Pink! <br>
               <br>
               Anomalies: Previous caretakers have reported a foul, slimy residue appearing on surfaces and objects near Shelby. <br>
                This substance ceases to manifest when small shrines are assembled around her. <br>
                In its place, a sweet, floral scent begins to emanate.

                <br>
               Discovered: 1987, Ethiopia  <br>
               <br>
               Aura: Harsh White <br>
               <br>
               Anomalies: Three distinct figures, believed to be manifestations of a single entity.
             When kept in separate rooms, caretakers have reported no anamolous behavior. However, when placed together, subtle disturbances beginâ€”small objects shift positions, often ending up misplaced or deliberately arranged.

                Sharp objects, in particular, tend to appear on the floor. <br>
                <br> Recommendation: keep the figures apart-or wear shoes.

                Entity ID: 7 12 9 20 3 8 9 14 20 8 5 13 1 20 18 9 24  ; <br> No offical name reported, dubbed Lamp <br>
                <br>
               Discovered: 1993, US <br>
               <br>
               Aura: ? <br>
               <br>  Anomalies: Do not stare directly at the Lamp for more than 30 seconds. <br>
                Prolonged exposure often results in an indefinite trance. While each case varies, all describe the sensation of entering a parallel timeline.

                Time behaves differently in the trance, seconds feel like years. The entranced experience free-will in the parallel time, yet remain unaware of the spell until it breaks.

                Only one other entity has exhibited similar effects, once tied a Lamp. Its location is unknown, and its legacy lives on in the naming of this one.
