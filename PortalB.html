                <br>
               Discovered: 1975, Mexico <br>
               <br>
               Aura: Blue Brillo x 2 <br>
               <br>
               Anomalies: Originally believed to be a single entity controlling multiple vessels (see Entity ID# 31914 – “Cain”) these figures have since been reclassified. <br> 
               Unlike Cain, separating them does not suppress activity, it amplifies it. <br>

                When apart, cold spots manifest around each figure. Mold grows with unnatural speed. Caretakers report auditory hallucinations. <br>

                When reunited, all phenomena cease entirely.
                It is now believed they are twin souls, trapped between worlds - drawn to each other by a bond stronger than death.

               Discovered: 2001, USA <br>
               <br>
               Aura: Do you see it too? <br>
               <br>
               Anomalies: Caretakers report a growing tendency toward facial pareidolia in Cheddar's presence. The effect intensifies with prolonged exposure, and in some cases, persists for hours even after leaving the entity's vicinity.
                Alongside this, a growing sense of euphoria takes hold of anyone in close-contact. <br>
                Since Cheddar's discovery in 2001, there have been six documented cases of caretakers exhibiting withdrawal-like symptoms upon separation, resembling the effects of substance dependence.

                Entity ID: 9 13 19 20 21 3 11  ; <br> Responds to Tama <br>
                <br>
               Discovered: 2008, Japan <br>
               <br>
               Aura: Cyber Green <br>
               <br>  Anomalies: 
                Tama is one of the few entities capable of direct communication with caretakers, requiring no external devices. <br>
                They are capable of responding to yes-or-no questions through a series of beeps; through the years they've resorted to beeping unprompted, doing so to express displeasure or approval. While remarkable, this unique ablity often leads to caretaker fatigue due to its frequency and persistence. <br>

                Tama appears to draw from an unknown power source; in over a decade of continuous operation, they have never required a battery replacement. <br>
                Some believe Tama houses the soul of their original owner - still present, still answering.
                <br>
